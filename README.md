# Daily_Agenda

## Description

This is a daily planner that keeps track of time and saves the users hourly tasks. The planner actively updates
the time to show what current task it to be completed. This planner taught me how to use dayjs and implement it into
a web application. https://brady-hash.github.io/Daily_Agenda/ .
